Filament Ban Manager is a user-friendly plugin that provides complete ban management (both models and IPs) for your Filament panel, built on top of the [Banhammer](https://github.com/mchev/banhammer) package.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require rectitude-open/filament-ban-manager
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-ban-manager-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```
> Note: The migrations from the Banhammer package have been integrated and optimized in this plugin, so you do not need to publish Banhammer's migrations separately.

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-ban-manager-config"
```

Optionally, you can publish the config file of the Banhammer package:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mchev\Banhammer\BanhammerServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    'filament_resource' => RectitudeOpen\FilamentBanManager\Resources\BanResource::class,
    'model' => RectitudeOpen\FilamentBanManager\Models\Ban::class,
    'navigation_sort' => 0,
];
```

## Usage

The package provides a Ban resource that allows you to create and delete bans for both models and IP addresses.

To use the resource page provided by this package, you need to register it in your Panel Provider provider first.

```php
namespace App\Providers\Filament;

use RectitudeOpen\FilamentBanManager\FilamentBanManagerPlugin;

class AdminPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            ->plugins([
                FilamentBanManagerPlugin::make()
            ]);
    }
}    
```
